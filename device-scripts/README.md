# Diagnostic Tool for a Device

This is a diagnostic tool that can be used to help diagnose problems
with devices. It must be run as root because it needs to access
network, and TLS keys and in general secure directories.

## How to Get It

The script is available in the lmp-tools repo. To downloaded and setup:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/foundriesio/lmp-tools/master/device-scripts/fio-diag.sh
chmod 755 fio-diag.sh
sudo -s
```

## How To Run It

The script can be placed in any location on a device typically in either `root/` or `fio/`.

The recommended way to execute it is:

```
# ./fio-diag.sh | tee results.txt
```
